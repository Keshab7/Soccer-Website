    <h2>The Rivalry Messi and Ronaldo</h2>
    <p class="Text"> Although Soccer has changed drastically in the recent years, it still remains the biggest sport in the world and it continues to grow every year. This could be because of the two players that have dominated the soccer stage for 15 years now. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have made the biggest impact in soccer. These two have been nominated for the best player award, every year since 2007. Anyone who knows soccer knows who these two are and even many non soccer fans have heard their names. Throughout the years, these two have just about broke every single record, and each year they break their own records. They have been the best for many years now. However, they are getting older, their time for retirement is nearing and with the two best players gone the future of soccer is open for new players to claim that title.</p>
