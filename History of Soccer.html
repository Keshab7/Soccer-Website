<h1>The History of Soccer</h1>
<p>When it comes to the Origins of Soccer, it is a little more complicated than it should be, many countries and cultures want to be credited for the invention of the beautiful game but we still do not know the true origins. The ancient Greek, Chinese and Romans all believe that they were the creators of the game from over 2,000 years ago. Although we do not know where it all began, we do know that England are credited for what soccer is today. They established a few rules and created uniformed soccer like it is today. The English introduced the rules of no hands allowed, penalties and much more. During WWI soccer even stopped a war, even if it was for just a day or two. Christmas of 1914, many German and British soldiers stopped fighting and enjoyed the game of soccer, sang carols and exchanged presents with cigarettes and food. However, after boxing day the war once again set afoot. Through its many years, soccer has evolved and grown even bigger and better. All new rules, players, and teams have made modern soccer what it is today.
