<h2>Future of Soccer</h2>
<p>The future of soccer is very open, but many fans don’t want to think about the future because a world where Ronaldo and Messi don’t play is going to be a depressing time in the soccer world. However, there are many players right now that have the potential to take the crown of world's best player. Neymar and Mbappe are strong candidates for this title, Neymar at the age of just 26 became the most expensive player to ever be sold at $263 million, although he has received many injuries since then, people still consider him one of the best players. Mbappe in the other hand is only 20 years old and has already reached amazing milestones. During the world cup, he became the youngest player to score in the final and even won the world cup for France. The World Cup, the most prestigious award in soccer. He has also won the best player award for under 21, an award almost made just for him. With the departure of Ronaldo and Messi, there’s no doubt that these two and many more players will shine even brighter.</p>
