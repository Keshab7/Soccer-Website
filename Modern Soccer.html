    <h1>Modern Soccer</h1>
    <p>Modern soccer has become much more than just a game. Itâ€™s become a lifestyle, culture, business and much more. Countries like Argentina, Brazil, Spain, and many more have made soccer into a culture. In these countries they live for the sport of soccer, you see it everywhere you go, from people playing on the streets to griffities to posters all over the place. Nowadays, so many people are dependent on this game to provide for them financially, and emotionally. After Brazil's 1-7 loss against Germany in the 2014 World Cup, many fans burned their Brazil jerseys and some fans even unfortulately commited suicide due to the emotional pain. Modern Soccer, if anything has become a business in many ways, many clubs are selling their players for insane amounts of money. Neymar was bought by a French club for $263 million in the recent years making him the most expensive player of all time. Ronaldo, the best player at the time was sold for a world record fee of only $27 million. That is a difference of more than $200 million, within just a couple decades. This really goes to show how much the game has grown.
